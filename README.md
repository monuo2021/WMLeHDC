# LeHDC
This repository is a code sample for the paper [**LeHDC: Learning-Based Hyperdimensional Computing Classifier**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3489517.3530593) appearing at Proceedings of the 59th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (2022).

LeHDC is a binary HDC training framework that maps the existing HDC flow into an equivalent Binary Neural Network architecture.
