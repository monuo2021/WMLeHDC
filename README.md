# LeHDC

This repository is a code sample for the paper [**LeHDC: Learning-Based Hyperdimensional Computing Classifier**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3489517.3530593) appearing at Proceedings of the 59th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (2022).

## :wave:Learning-based HDC

LeHDC is a binary HDC training framework that maps the existing HDC flow into an equivalent Binary Neural Network architecture.

LeHDC can outperform current HDC-related models and has good scalability along vector dimensions.
